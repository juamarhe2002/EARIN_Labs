# EARIN Lab 7 Solution
This is the solution of the variant 3 of the Lab 7 made by Krzysztof Kotowski and Juan Manuel Aristizabal Henao.

The prolog file was run using the on-line swi-prolog environment.

For running this code:
1. Upload the file to the [on-line swi-prolog environment](https://swish.swi-prolog.org/). Or create a new __Program__ based on __Empty__ profile in that on-line environment and copy and paste the code of the __number_to_words.pl__ file.
2. Call the rule __to_words(N)__ with the desired number to be tested as the parameter __N__.
3. On the file, there are already written test cases that may be copied to the terminal to visualize their results.
